# Space Evaders, Arcade Game Clone

## About The Project
This project is a an HTML canvas game in the style of the arcade game frogger. It is part of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree coursework, and some starter code was provided by Udacity. There are no extra dependencies. Clone or download the repository and you are all set to play, or improve upon it and make it your own. 

## Directions
Use the arrow keys to maneuver the rocket ship to space. Each time you reach space you will receive 50 points. However, if you collide with an alien your points will be reset to 0, and you will return your starting position on the gameboard. When you have accummulated 150 points, you advance to the next level, where your points will be reset to zero. If you reach 150 points on level three, you win the game, at which point you can choose to play again or quit.
