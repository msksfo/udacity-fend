# Memory Game Project

## About the project
This is a classic game of concentration. The user can choose to play the standard version, or the queens version. The only difference is that the queens version is all the same aircraft type- 747. The gameboard is layed out with 16 cards, which contain 8 pairs of images. The user must click the cards to find the matching pairs. When all pairs have been found, the user wins the game and their stats are displayed - a star rating, the length of time it took them to find all pairs, and the number of moves they used. The user can choose to replay the game or quit.
