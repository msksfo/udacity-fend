# Memory Game Project

## About the project
This is a classic game of concentration. The user can choose to play the standard version, or the queens version. The only difference is that the queens version is all the same aircraft type- 747. The gameboard is layed out with 16 cards, which contain 8 pairs of images. The user must click the cards to find the matching pairs. When all pairs have been found, the user wins the game and their stats are displayed - a star rating, the length of time it took them to find all pairs, and the number of moves they used. The user can choose to replay the game or quit.

## Directions
First choose a version, the standard version, or the queens version (all 747's). Click a card to reveal an image, then click another card. If the two images match, the cards will stay open. If they do not match, try to remember which picture was behind which card, because after a short pause both images will be hidden again. It is your job to find all eight pairs of matching images on the gameboard. If you wish to restart while in the middle of a game, you may do so by clicking the restart icon. Note - clicking restart will start over on the same version of the game. When you finish a game, you will have the option to play again or quit.
