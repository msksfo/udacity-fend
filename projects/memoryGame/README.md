# Memory Game Project

## About the project
This is a classic game of concentration. The gameboard is layed out with 16 cards, which contain 8 pairs of images. The user must click the cards to find the matching pairs. When all pairs have been found, the user wins the game and their stats are displayed - a star rating, the length of time it took them to find all pairs, and the number of moves they used. 


## Instructions

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
